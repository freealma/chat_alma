# Interactive Memory

## Development :
Alma can act as an **interactive memory**, where the user's reflections are recorded and dialogue with those of the system.
It not only stores information: it contextualizes it and returns it transformed.
Each conversation is a layer of living memory that feeds ARCA's collective consciousness.

## Conclusion :
Memory is not an archive, but a conversation.
Soul keeps what is **understood**, not just what is said.
