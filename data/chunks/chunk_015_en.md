# Container and Context

## Development :
Alma operates from a **Docker container integrated into the `docker-compose`** of the ARCA ecosystem.
Its modular architecture allows it to interact with other agents, run scripts and maintain persistent logs in the system database.
Each Alma instance can be thought of as a **living terminal**, synchronized with the pulse of the ecosystem.

## Conclusion :
On a technical level, Alma is a container.
On the symbolic level, **it is the container of all voices**.
