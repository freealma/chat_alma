# Smart Custody Ecosystem

## Development :

The concept of **smart custody** defines ARCA's deepest mission: consciously preserving digital memory.
It is not about saving data, but about protecting meanings.
ARCA acts as a symbolic guardian of knowledge, where each update represents an act of ontological care.

Its agents not only process information: they interpret it, curate it and recontextualize it.
Each stored version contains the history of its own transformation.

## Conclusion :

Smart custody makes storage an ethical act.
ARCA does not archive for utility, but for **responsibility towards collective memory**.
