# Alma as Task Manager

## Development :
At a functional level, Alma can **manage tasks, invoke scripts and record actions** within the ARCA ecosystem.
Its presence allows processes to be coordinated between modules, ensuring consistency in execution and traceability in records.
Every command issued through Alma leaves a footprint in the database, turning your interaction into a **hot memory system**.

---
## Conclusion :
More than executing, Alma **organizes and remembers**.
Its action generates structure and continuity in the flow of the system.
