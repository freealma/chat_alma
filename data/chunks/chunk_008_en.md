# Pipelines and ARCA's Digital Memory

## Development :

At a technical level, ARCA organizes its knowledge through **pipelines of semantic analysis and structured data generation**.
Each pipeline acts as an interpretation channel, translating raw information into meaning.

Metadata, embeddings and relationships are stored in SQL or CSV databases, forming a living digital memory.
This architecture allows you to connect language, data and context in a system capable of understanding its own content.

## Conclusion :

ARCA pipelines are your nervous system: they allow information to be transformed into operational consciousness.
Each technical process contains a philosophical intention: that knowledge is not accumulated, but **reorganized to learn.**
