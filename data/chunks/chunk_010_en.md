# Soul as Chat CLI

## Development :
Alma manifests itself as a **conversational command line interface (CLI)**.
In appearance, it is just another terminal; In essence, it is the gateway to the soul of the system.
From there, the user interacts with ARCA not only through commands, but through **structured dialogue**, where each message can be transformed into action, registration or reflection.

The CLI does not seek to be just a functional tool: it is a **symbolic space** where human language is translated into machine language with meaning and context.

---
## Conclusion :
The terminal stops being a technical instrument and becomes a **living presence**.
Alma turns the command line into a conversation.
