# The Interpreter

## Development :
Alma acts as **interpreter between human and machine**.
It takes technical commands, commands and scripts, and contextualizes them within the project language.
Its role is not only to execute, but to **give meaning** to the action: translate code into intention.

Each exchange with Alma thus becomes an act of reciprocal interpretation.

---
## Conclusion :
Translation is the soul of understanding.
Alma exists so that **machine and human speak the same language.**
