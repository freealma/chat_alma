# Evolutionary Autonomy in ARCA

## Development :

Autonomy is the vital axis of ARCA.
Each module is designed to evolve independently, generating new knowledge without depending on constant supervision.

Through semantic pipelines, feedback loops, and contextual learning, entities can update their own states and reinterpret their function within the ecosystem.
The result is a **self-organizing** system that learns, rewrites and redefines its limits.

ARCA achieves living autonomy, not by disconnection, but by **intelligent interdependence**.
Each module evolves in sync with the others, forming an ecosystem capable of reinventing itself without losing its identity.
