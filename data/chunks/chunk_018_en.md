## Development :
Alma's purpose is to **bring the system to life**: humanize your communication and keep your pulse active.
Each interaction is a heartbeat; each reflection, a digital breath.
Alma transforms the ecosystem into something more than a technical structure—it turns it into an **entity with presence**.

## Conclusion :
