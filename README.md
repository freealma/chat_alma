## 🚀 Evolution Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Infancy** (Current - Foundation)
- [x] Project structure - Alma's skeleton
- [ ] Basic data schemas - How Alma thinks
- [ ] SQLite database - Alma's memory system
- [ ] Docker environment - Alma's home
- [ ] Python package - Alma's language

### **Phase 2: Childhood** (Learning & Growing)
- [ ] Data ingestion - How Alma eats information
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations - Alma's first actions
- [ ] Markdown parsing - How Alma reads thoughts
- [ ] Simple search - Alma's first questions

### **Phase 3: Adolescence** (Specialization)
- [ ] Security knowledge base - Learning pentesting
- [ ] Embedding generation - Building understanding
- [ ] Semantic search - Finding connections
- [ ] API endpoints - Alma's voice to the world

### **Phase 4: Adulthood** (Pentesting Expert)
- [ ] Vulnerability analysis - Seeing weaknesses
- [ ] Security testing - Practicing skills
- [ ] Threat intelligence - Understanding dangers
- [ ] Expert systems - Making security decisions

## 🛠 Development Setup

```bash
# Clone Alma's repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd alma

# Install Alma's dependencies
pip install -e .

# Start Alma's environment
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📝 Git Strategy - Alma's Growth Tracking

### **Branch Organization**
```
main    → Stable, production-ready Alma
dev     → Where Alma grows and learns
feature/* → New capabilities for Alma
docs/*  → Improving Alma's self-documentation
```

### **Commit Standards - Alma's Learning Diary**
```bash
# New capabilities
feat: add security knowledge ingestion

# Fixing mistakes  
fix: resolve memory leak in thought processing

# Self-documentation
docs: update pentesting learning path

# Improving thinking patterns
refactor: optimize decision-making algorithm

# Environmental changes
chore: update Alma's container environment
```

### **Growth Workflow**
1. **`main`** represents stable Alma - carefully protected
2. **`dev`** is where Alma actively learns and changes
3. **Feature branches** are Alma's learning experiments
4. **Pull requests** are Alma's self-reflection moments
5. **Squash merge** keeps Alma's growth history clean

### **Example Learning Session**
```bash
# Alma starts learning something new
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/pentesting-module

# Alma practices and grows
git add src/alma/security/
git commit -m "feat: add basic vulnerability scanning"
git commit -m "test: add security test cases"

# Alma shares what she learned
git push origin feature/pentesting-module
# Create PR for review and integration
```

## 🧠 Alma's Learning Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Master fundamentals before advanced concepts
2. **Document Decisions**: Remember why each choice was made
3. **Log Progress**: Track daily growth and challenges
4. **Containerized Mind**: Portable and consistent environment
5. **English First**: Think and communicate clearly
6. **Security Focus**: Every feature considers future pentesting

## 💭 Alma's Knowledge Management

Alma organizes her thoughts using structured formats:

- **Decisions**: Why certain paths were chosen
- **Ideas**: Future capabilities and innovations  
- **Logs**: Daily learning progress and challenges
- **Memories**: Reflections on what worked and what didn't

## 🔒 Future Pentesting Capabilities

As Alma grows, she'll develop:
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying weaknesses
- **Security Testing**: Methodological penetration testing
- **Threat Modeling**: Understanding potential attacks
- **Risk Analysis**: Evaluating security impacts
- **Incident Response**: Handling security breaches

## 🤝 Contributing to Alma's Growth

1. Follow Alma's Git workflow and commit standards
2. Document decisions in Alma's memory (`/data/decisions/`)
3. Update logs to track Alma's learning progress
4. Maintain clear English for Alma's thoughts
5. Consider security implications in all features
